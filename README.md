# Examples

Examples of Voting Methods and Tabulation, in both python and notebook format.

**New!** [Live demo of the repository](https://electionscience.github.io/examples/lab/index.html)

## Methods

When single winner methods are equivalent to a multi winner method with one seat, the single winner method is not included for simplicity. For example, Approval Voting and Sequential Proportional Approval Voting yield the same first winner with the same methodology, so Approval Voting is not included as a separate example.

### Tests

`python -m unittest tests/test_methods.py`

### Rated Methods

- [Sequential Proportional Approval Voting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequential_proportional_approval_voting) (SPAV)
- [Method of Equal Shares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_of_Equal_Shares) (MES)
- [STAR-PR](https://electowiki.org/wiki/Allocated_Score)

### Ranked Methods

- [Single Transferable Vote](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_transferable_vote) (AKA STV, Proportional IRV, Propotional RCV, Proportional Hare)

## Contributions

Please include both a python version and a notebook version. Notebooks should have completed results so they can be viewed in Github without execution.
PRs are welcome.
